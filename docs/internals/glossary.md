# Glossary

Terms whose meaning matters across T3 Code. Architecture and lifecycle constraints belong in the
[overview](./overview.md), not in these definitions.

## Workspace and conversation

| Term           | Meaning                                                                                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Environment    | One running server and the machine, credentials, workspace access, and state it owns.             |
| Client         | A web, desktop, or mobile UI connected to an environment. The desktop app can also host a server. |
| Project        | An environment-local workspace record rooted at a directory.                                      |
| Workspace root | The project's base filesystem directory on the environment.                                       |
| Worktree       | A separate Git checkout a thread can use instead of the project's main checkout.                  |
| Thread         | The durable conversation and work history for a project. It survives provider process exits.      |
| Turn           | One user-to-agent work cycle. Provider work can finish before checkpoint and diff work settles.   |
| Activity       | A non-message timeline item, such as a tool action, approval, or failure.                         |
| T3 home        | The base data directory. Runtime state normally lives under its `userdata` directory.             |

## Orchestration

| Term                    | Meaning                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Command                 | A request to change domain state. Accepting it does not mean its side effects have finished. |
| Event                   | A persisted fact produced by a command.                                                      |
| Decider                 | The pure logic that turns a command and current state into events.                           |
| Projection / read model | A view of current state derived from persisted events.                                       |
| Projector               | The logic that applies events to a read model.                                               |
| Reactor                 | A worker that performs follow-up work in response to recorded intent or runtime signals.     |
| Command receipt         | A durable record of a command's result, used to make retries idempotent.                     |
| Runtime receipt         | A test-only signal that an asynchronous milestone completed.                                 |
| Quiesced                | The relevant follow-up workers have finished, beyond the provider turn merely ending.        |

## Providers and checkpoints

| Term                | Meaning                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Provider            | The agent runtime T3 Code controls, such as Codex or Claude Code.                                            |
| Driver              | The integration for a provider kind.                                                                         |
| Provider instance   | One configured provider, with its own settings and lifecycle. Multiple instances can use the same driver.    |
| Adapter             | The boundary translating a provider's native protocol into T3 Code operations and events.                    |
| Session             | The provider runtime attached to a thread. A session can be stopped and resumed without deleting the thread. |
| Runtime mode        | The thread's permission policy. See [permission modes](../user/permission-modes.md).                         |
| Interaction mode    | How the agent approaches the task, such as planning. Separate from permission policy.                        |
| Checkpoint          | A saved workspace state used for diffs and restore, stored as a hidden Git ref.                              |
| Checkpoint baseline | The workspace state captured before the work being compared.                                                 |
| Turn diff           | The workspace changes attributed to one turn.                                                                |

## Workflow planning

| Term              | Meaning                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Wayfinder map     | An effort's destination, decision index, remaining unknowns and scope boundaries.                   |
| Decision ticket   | A question whose resolution records a decision rather than delivering code.                         |
| Decision frontier | A map's unclaimed, open decision tickets with satisfied dependencies and no pending reassessment.   |
| Capability        | A coherent piece of functionality described by one specification and delivered through its tickets. |
| Workflow director | An agent that coordinates a capability's delivery tickets and independent review.                   |
| Director batch    | The distinct delivery tickets taken on by one director before handing over to a successor.          |
| Delivery ticket   | A bounded piece of implementation work with acceptance criteria and explicit blockers.              |
| Workflow approval | The owner's acceptance of a specific specification or ticket breakdown.                             |
| Resolution record | An outcome and supporting evidence for a decision, delivery ticket or capability.                   |
| Reassessment      | Review of affected work after its scope or prerequisites change or their completion is unverified.  |
